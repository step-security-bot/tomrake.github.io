Wow! I am a 61 year old, Computer Engineering graduate.

### Why you should ignore this blog

Largely this blog is notes to myself on little fussy topics, where things do not work
as expected. Lately I have been working/playing with LISP.

I have also worked:

* mostly in Windows but
* sometimes in Linux decades ago.
* in java and  eclipse.
* in Pharo - Smalltalk.
* on renewable energy methods and markets.
* somtimes in R.
* architectural drafting in AutoCAD.
* 6502 programming on an Apple ][
* analysis of the waterpark industry
* Assembly on a CDC 6400
* a treasurer for a third party congressional candidate.
