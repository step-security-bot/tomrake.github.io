In a report from the Bree Daily, Sauron, of Mordor, has reportedly paid 44 Billion Dollars in exchange for a Seer Stone called "Twitter",
a dollar being some odd foreign currency made of paper.
</p>

<p>
Mayor Sam Gangee, of Bag End, has been quoted that
"he knows nothing of any of Sauron's latest dealings" but
is "quite certain that no Rings of Power are involved."

None of the other hobbit adventures could be reached for comment.
