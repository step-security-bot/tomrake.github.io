A few days ago I did a series of hashtag searches and found groups of conversations of a bunch of interesting topics.
Hashtags add speed and excitement to Mastodon.
</p>

<p>
Mastodon was designed with "friction" to slow down the propagation of information.
By forcing propagation of post through posts of individuals and the lack of site wide search.
Mastodon promote small conversations and not the quick spread of mass outrage

<h2 id="org501e549">A Very Cheesy example</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org501e549">
<p>
Let's say you want to aim you hate at lovers of cheese, and your passion is spewing hate at all cheese lovers.
</p>

<p>
On the bird site you could search for "cheese" and easily find all the suspected members of the cheese cabal,
and easily spew nasty remarks to fans of the evil dairy product.
On Mastodon there is no global text search this protects the precious cheese lovers from the casual hater.
Mastodon has global search for hashtags, so you could communicate with other cheese hate member by using the #cheese-sucks hashtag.

<h2 id="org53d0c55">Lawfare posts have hashtags</h2>

<p>
[Lawfare Blog](<a href="https://lawfareblog.com/">https://lawfareblog.com/</a>) one of my favorite source for legal and intelligence community view points is listing their various posts with hashtags,
here is an example this [Democracy After the Midterms](<a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/democracy-after-midterms">https://www.lawfareblog.com/democracy-after-midterms</a>)
by [Quinta Jurecic](@qjurecic@mastodon.social) attaches the hashtags #USElections #USPolitics #Biden #DonaldTrump #America.
I follow Quinta on Mastodon, so I expect posts like her article but the hash point to other viewpoints on related topics.
This is a very good example many if not all Lawfareblog articles are well-thought-out and deserve a well considered read.
